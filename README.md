# filler

School's subject:
Create your player program to compete against other students on the
famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on
a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the
form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a
piece can no longer be placed. Little playful project!

My filler:
Each turn, my program will evaluate all the possible moves with the given piece.
In order to do so, it calculate a score for each possible moves, depending of the distance from the last piece played by the opponant.
